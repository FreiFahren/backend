# FreiFahren

## Overview

Freifahren is an innovative project designed to map the presence of ticket inspectors across the Berlin public transport network. By offering a live map that tracks inspectors in real-time, the initiative seeks to inform and empower users to navigate the city with added confidence. The project leverages community-driven data from the [Freifahren Telegram group](https://t.me/freifahren_BE), where users report sightings of ticket inspectors. This repository is the backend that powers the Freifahren web application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go version 1.22 or later
- PostgreSQL 13 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FreiFahren/backend
    ```

2. Install Go packages
    ```sh
    go mod download
    ```

3. Set up the database

### Running the application

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables
    ```sh
    DB_USER
    DB_PASSWORD
    DB_HOST
    DB_PORT  
    DB_NAME
    ```

2. Run the application
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

## How it works

We have several API endpoints that allow users to interact with the application. The main endpoints are:

### Getting the id of a station

- `/id` - This endpoint is used to get the id of a station given its name. It is case and whitespace insensitive.

The request should be a `GET` request with the following query parameters:
    - `name` - The name of the station

**Example:**
```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/id?name=alexanderplatz"
```

It will return the id as a text response.

**Response:**
```sh
"SU-A"
```

### Reporting a new inspector sighting

- `/newInspector` - This endpoint is used to add a new inspector sighting to the database.

The request should be a `POST` request with the following JSON body:
    - `line` - The line on which the inspector was sighted (optional)
    - `station` - The station at which the inspector was sighted (optional)
    - `direction` - The direction in which the inspector was headed (optional)

Example:
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/newInspector \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"line":"S7","station":"Alexanderplatz","direction":"Ahrensfelde"}'
```

It will return a json response with the content of the inspector sighting.

**Response:**
```json
{"line":"S7","station":{"id":"SU-A","name":"Alexanderplatz"},"direction":{"id":"S-Ah","name":"Ahrensfelde"}}
```

### Receive the last known stations 15 mins ago

- `/recent` - This endpoint is used to get the last known stations 15 mins ago. It uses if-Modified-Since to cache the response and only return a new response if the data has changed.

The request should be a `GET` request, with this example, where the header timestamp is before the last known sighting of an inspector.:

**Example:**
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/recent \
     -H "If-Modified-Since: 2024-03-19T18:07:40.893188Z"
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2024-03-17T14:42:25.932507Z",
    "station": {
      "id": "SU-HMS",
      "name": "Hermannstra√üe",
      "coordinates": {
        "latitude": 52.467622,
        "longitude": 13.4309698
      }
    },
    "direction": {
      "id": "",
      "name": "",
      "coordinates": {
        "latitude": 0,
        "longitude": 0
      }
    },
    "line": "U8"
  },
]

```

If there is no 'If-Modified-Since' header, it will return the same response as the previous example.

If the 'If-Modified-Since' header is after the last known sighting of an inspector, it will return a `304 Not Modified` response.


### Get all stations and lines list

- `/list` - This endpoint is used to GET an overview of all stations and lines, and their connections


The request should be a `GET` request, with this example:

**Example:**
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/list \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "lines": [
    {
      "U1": ["SU-WA", "etc.."]
    },
    
    
  ],
  "stations": {
    "U-Ado": {
      "name": "Adenauer Platz",
            "coordinates": {
                "latitude": 52.4998948,
                "longitude": 13.3071423
            },
            "lines": [
                "U7"
            ]
        },
    }
}

```
